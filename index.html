    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p><b>Whenever</b> I feel bored, I turn on the music player on my mobile phone.

        I have a <em>huge collection</em> of different music, and this makes more interesting and exciting to listen to the music.
         My parents often get irritated to see me listening to the music.
         <b>However</b>, my dad is <strong>very fond of listening to the music</strong> himself, and appreciates me for my hobby listening music.
          <em>It has been years</em>, since it has become my hobby. And, truly speaking, <strong>I really do not know since when it became my prime interest.</strong>
           I also own an iPad, and it also has a huge collection of variety of music. 
           Among the large collection, <em>the Bollywood and the Pop music are the two top ones.</em>
        
        
        I am quite interested in sports such as <b>cricket and football.</b>
         As cricket is <strong>most popular sports in India</strong>, I keenly watch cricket matches of my favourite teams. </p>
